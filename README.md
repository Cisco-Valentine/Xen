# Xen

Xen is a multi-purpose bot, with moderation capabilities! It has few commands centered around Pok√©two, which is a Pok√©mon bot. It also has utility commands and much more! Its main feature is to identify Pok√©mons spawned by Pok√©two.

# Developer
Future#9409

# Information
Xen was made to help Pok√©two players, it will tell you what Pok√©mon spawned, along with many other feature. This will make sure you never have to use google to search for some Pok√©mon you might not know! Adding a automatic Shiny Hunt and Rare feature will make sure you never miss a rare Pok√©mon or your Shiny Hunt!

# Premium
To gain something out of making a huge project like this, where I provided over 900k images, I need to make some money, I am not making it very expensive as I understand some people may not be able to afford this! The cost for premium is 5$, you also can get 150k Pok√©coins along with your purchase!

# Rumors
**I wanted to clear some rumors up!**

**This bot is `not` against Discord TOS and Pok√©two code of conduct.**
> [Discord TOS](https://discord.com/terms)  
> [Pok√©two TOS](https://poketwo.net/code-of-conduct)

It does not catch the Pok√©mon, but says the name so it is `not` a selfbot. Pok√©two's bot creator, [Oliver Ni](https://github.com/oliver-ni) has approved this bot and said it is safe for people to use.

> Discord's API provides a separate type of user account dedicated to automation, called a bot account. Bot accounts can be created through the applications page, and are authenticated using a token (rather than a username and password). Unlike the normal OAuth2 flow, bot accounts have full access to all API routes without using bearer tokens, and can connect to the Real Time Gateway. Automating normal user accounts (generally called "self-bots") outside of the OAuth2/bot API is forbidden, and can result in an account termination if found. -Discord

Selfbots are able to interact with other bots, and my bot Xen cannot, a selfbot is a bot without a bot tag. A regular discord bot should always have a verified bot tag or a bot tag.
