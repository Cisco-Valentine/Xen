# Xen

Xen is a multi-purpose bot, with moderation capabilities! It has few commands centered around Pokétwo, which is a Pokémon bot. It also has utility commands and much more! Its main feature is to identify Pokémons spawned by Pokétwo.

# Rumors
### I wanted to clear some rumors up!

**This bot is `not` against Discord TOS and Pokétwo code of conduct.**
> [Discord TOS](https://discord.com/terms)  
> [Pokétwo TOS](https://poketwo.net/code-of-conduct)

It does not catch the Pokémon, but says the name so it is `not` a selfbot. Pokétwo's bot creator, [Oliver Ni](https://github.com/oliver-ni) has approved this bot and said it is safe for people to use.  

> Discord's API provides a separate type of user account dedicated to automation, called a bot account. Bot accounts can be created through the applications page, and are authenticated using a token (rather than a username and password). Unlike the normal OAuth2 flow, bot accounts have full access to all API routes without using bearer tokens, and can connect to the Real Time Gateway. Automating normal user accounts (generally called "self-bots") outside of the OAuth2/bot API is forbidden, and can result in an account termination if found. -Discord
